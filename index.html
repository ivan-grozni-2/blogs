            <p class="post-snippet">I’m a passionate beginner developer and computer enthusiast, ready to take on my first programming job here on Upwork. While I may not have much experience in paid programming roles yet, I’ve built a strong foundation through self-study and hands-on learning.

                I’m skilled in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and MySQL, and I’m continuously working to deepen and expand my knowledge. My background in computer maintenance and system monitoring has trained me to be detail-oriented and highly focused.

                I’m excited to work with clients, grow through real-world experience, and bring value through hard work and dedication.
